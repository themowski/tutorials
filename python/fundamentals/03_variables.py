# Memory is used to store data
# A variable is a name for a location in memory
x = 1 # 1 is the contents of a piece of memory and x is pointing to it
y = x # y is pointing to the same piece of memory as x
z = 2 # z is pointing to a different piece of memory


CONSTANT_VALUE = 10 # Convention: all-upper case variable means the value won't change
