### Install git for your operating system

We will be using git on a Linux server, which we'll access via [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/). For your own use you'll want to download a distribution of git for your operating system.

[Git downloads](http://git-scm.com/downloads)

###### Recommended git GUI clients
* GitHub for [Windows](https://windows.github.com/) or [Mac OS X](https://mac.github.com/)
* [SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) for Windows or Mac OS X

You need to have a general idea how git works before using any client (GUI or command line). It's best to start learning from the command line, since the command line interface is the same on all platforms, while GUIs offer different subsets of the command line functionality in different forms.
